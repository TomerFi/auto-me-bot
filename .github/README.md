Managing a repository can be cumbersome :construction_worker: and tiresome :tired_face:.</br>
Let alone managing multiple repositories used by multiple contributors and bots :anguished:.</br>

My name is [**auto-me-bot**][auto-me-bot-app]!</br>
I was created with [Probot][probot-pages] :robot: and I live my life
as a _serverless function_ residing in [AWS Lambda][aws-lambda] :floppy_disk:.</br>

I'm here to take some of the repo management load off your shoulders, just tell me what you want me to do...</br>
Place a file :memo: called **auto-me-bot.yml** in your **.github** folder :file_folder: in the repos you want me to help out with.</br>

```yaml
# .github/auto-me-bot.yml
---
pr:
  conventionalCommits: # this means I'll enforce conventional commit messages in PRs.
  lifecycleLabels: # this means you I'll label PRs based on the their lifecycle.
  signedCommits: # this means I'll make sure all commits in PRs are signed with the 'Signed-off-by' trailer.
  tasksList: # this means I'll verify completion of tasks list in PRs.
```

> Place the file in your **.github** repository if you want me to take on multiple repos with one file :muscle:.

Check out the [documentation][auto-me-bot-doc] to see what else I can do :call_me_hand:.

## Future Plans

- Size based labeling for pull requests.
- Automate assignees and reviewers for pull requests.
- Auto approving pull requests with consideration to GitHub code owners.
- Various handlers for event types other then _pull_request_, such as _push_ and and _issue_ event types.
- Repository management capabilities, such as labels creation and settings syncing.

## Alternatives

Other awesome applications the offer similar handlers as [auto-me-bot][auto-me-bot-app]:

- [DCO][dco]
- [Semantic Pull Request][semantic-pull-request]
- [Task List Completed][task-list-completed]
- [Trafico][trafico]

## Works well with

If you keep your commits conventional,</br>
you can use the [version-bumper-action][version-bumper-action] for _GitHub_, to automate your releases.
