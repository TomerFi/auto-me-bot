# CI/CD Workflows

- Use `npm ci` for CI/CD installs (not `npm install`)
- Pin action versions (e.g., `actions/checkout@v6`)
- Keep Probot and commitlint updated
- Deployment uses GCP Cloud Functions Gen2 via `gcloud functions deploy`
- The `--allow-unauthenticated` flag is NOT used; `allUsers` invoker access is set manually
