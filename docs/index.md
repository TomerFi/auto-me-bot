Managing a repository can be cumbersome :construction_worker: and tiresome :tired_face:.</br>
Let alone managing multiple repositories used by multiple contributors and bots :anguished:.</br>

My name is **auto-me-bot**!</br>
I was created with [Probot](https://probot.github.io/) :robot: and I live my life
as a _serverless function_ residing in [AWS Lambda](https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/) :floppy_disk:.</br>

I'm here to take some of the load off your shoulders, just tell me what you want me to do...</br>
Place a file :memo: called **auto-me-bot.yml** in your **.github** folder :file_folder: in the repos you want me to help out with.</br>
